A bad penny always turns up
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A cat may look at a king
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
A dog is a man's best friend
A drowning man will clutch at a straw
A fish always rots from the head down
A fool and his money are soon parted
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A golden key can open any door
A good man is hard to find
A house divided against itself cannot stand
A leopard cannot change its spots
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
A little learning is a dangerous thing
A little of what you fancy does you good
A man who is his own lawyer has a fool for his client
A miss is as good as a mile
A nod's as good as a wink to a blind horse
A penny saved is a penny earned
A picture paints a thousand words
A place for everything and everything in its place
A rolling stone gathers no moss
A stitch in time saves nine
A thing of beauty is a joy forever
A watched pot never boils
A woman's place is in the home
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Accidents will happen
All good things come to he who waits
All is grist that comes to the mill
All publicity is good publicity
All that glisters is not gold
All that glitters is not gold
All things come to those that wait
All things must pass
All's well that ends well
A miss is as good as a mile
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An Englishman's home is his castle
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
As thick as thieves
As you sow so shall you reap
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Ask a silly question and you'll get a silly answer
Beat swords into ploughshares
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep
Beggars should not be choosers
Behind every great man there's a great woman
Better late than never
Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts
Beware the Ides of March
Birds of a feather flock together
Blessed are the peacemakers
Blood is thicker than water
Brevity is the soul of wit
Carpe diem
Charity begins at home
Children should be seen and not heard
Comparisons are odious
Devil take the hindmost
Different strokes for different folks
Discretion is the better part of valour
Do as you would be done by
Do unto others as you would have them do to you
Don't cast your pearls before swine
Don't change horses in midstream
Don't count your chickens before they are hatched
Don't keep a dog and bark yourself
Don't let the bastards grind you down
Don't let the cat out of the bag
Don't put the cart before the horse
Don't shut the stable door after the horse has bolted
Don't teach your Grandma to suck eggs
Don't throw good money after bad
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Don't upset the apple-cart
Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise
Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die
Enough is as good as a feast
Enough is enough
Even a worm will turn
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has its day
Every man has his price
Failing to plan is planning to fail
Fair exchange is no robbery
Faith will move mountains
Fight fire with fire
Fight the good fight
Fine words butter no parsnips
Fish always stink from the head down
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
For everything there is a season
Forewarned is forearmed
Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains
Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration
Give a man a fish and you will feed him for a day
Give the Devil his due
Good fences make good neighbours
Good things come to those that wait
Great minds think alike
Half a loaf is better than no bread
Hard cases make bad law
Haste makes waste
He who can does, he who cannot, teaches
He who laughs last laughs longest
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Hold with the hare and run with the hounds
Honesty is the best policy
If anything can go wrong, it will
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If the cap fits, wear it
If the mountain won't come to Mohammed, then Mohammed must go to the mountain
If the shoe fits, wear it
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It never rains but it pours
It's all grist to the mill
It's an ill wind that blows no one any good
It's better to give than to receive
It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
It's better to light a candle than curse the darkness
It's better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It's the early bird that catches the worm
Jack of all trades, master of none
Keep your chin up
Keep your powder dry
Know which side your bread is buttered
Less is more
Let not the sun go down on your wrath
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the buyer beware
Life begins at forty
Life's not all beer and skittles
Little pitchers have big ears
Look before you leap
Love of money is the root of all evil
Love is blind
Love thy neighbour as thyself
Make hay while the sun shines
Man does not live by bread alone
Many a little makes a mickle
Many a mickle makes a muckle
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Many are called but few are chosen
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow
Money is the root of all evil
More haste, less speed
Music has charms to soothe the savage breast
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needs must when the devil drives
Ne'er cast a clout till May be out
Never give a sucker an even break
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
No man is an island
No names, no pack-drill
No rest for the wicked
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing succeeds like success
One good turn deserves another
One swallow does not make a summer
Out of sight, out of mind
Physician, heal thyself
Power corrupts; absolute power corrupts absolutely
Procrastination is the thief of time
Put your best foot forward
Quid pro quo
Red sky at night shepherd's delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd's warning
Revenge is a dish best served cold
Rob Peter to pay Paul
Rome wasn't built in a day
See a pin and pick it up, all the day you'll have good luck; see a pin and let it lie, bad luck you'll have all day
Share and share alike
Silence is golden
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Speak softly and carry a big stick
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me
Strike while the iron is hot
Take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves
Talk of the Devil, and he is bound to appear
Tell the truth and shame the Devil
The best-laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley
The bread always falls buttered side down
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
The course of true love never did run smooth
The customer is always right
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
The Devil makes work for idle hands to do
The Devil is in the details
The Devil take the hindmost
The early bird catches the worm
The exception which proves the rule
The fat is in the fire
The female of the species is more deadly than the male
The law is an ass
The leopard does not change his spots
The more the merrier
The opera ain't over till the fat lady sings
The pen is mightier than sword
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The truth will out
The wages of sin is death
There but for the grace of God, go I
There's a time and a place for everything
There's an exception to every rule
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no such thing as bad publicity
There's one born every minute
Third time lucky
Thou shalt not kill
Time and tide wait for no man
'tis better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all
To err is human; to forgive divine
To every thing there is a season
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
Tomorrow is another day
Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth will out
Two heads are better than one
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
Where there's muck there's brass
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
Women and children first
You are what you eat
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't get blood out of a turnip
You can't hold with the hare and run with the hounds
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You reap what you sow
